CSS3Goodness
============

Purpose
-------

To create an HTML5/CSS3/jQuery webapp that allows a user to test CSS3 goodies on
the fly and then have the code generated and displayed on the screen.

Hopefully over time I can grow this to include many CSS3 goodies but initially I
plan to focus on

- border-radius (rounded corners) 
- box-shadow (drop shadow)
- text-shadow (text drop shadow).

Caveats
-------

FYI - All of the action sans this README file is happening on the dev branch.
